## Application
This repository contains a python application that enables you to draw a digit between 0 and 9, the application will then proceed to predict the written digit using a convolutional neural network.

### model
The current trained model as an accuracy of 97.4%. The code to train this model is included in the repository `train_model_conv.py`. Training the Dense neural network can be done with `train_model_dense.py`. Both these scripts will generate a `.pkl` file that contains the model. 


I'm aware that there are a lot of points to improve upon. If you see any improvements feel free to contribute
